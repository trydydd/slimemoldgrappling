# Conditioning Macrocycles for BJJ Athletes

This plan includes an **onboarding macrocycle** to build foundational conditioning, followed by a **repeatable macrocycle** to sustain and progressively enhance fitness over time. Both cycles balance aerobic, alactic, and lactic systems, with HRV guiding daily intensity adjustments.

---

## **Onboarding Macrocycle (16 Weeks)**

### **Phase 1: Base Building (4–6 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Build aerobic capacity, develop alactic power, and gradually introduce lactic work.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Aerobic + Alactic Power**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 8 x 10-sec sprints, 90-sec rest + 40 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 30–40 min Zone 2 only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Anaerobic Lactic)**  
  - Normal HRV: Train as usual
  - Low HRV: Flow roll + 15 min recovery cardio

- **Wednesday — BJJ + Aerobic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 30 min Zone 2 post-training
  - Low HRV: 15 min light walking or skip

- **Thursday — BJJ + Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 5 x 10-sec sprints, 90-sec rest
  - Low HRV: Reduce to 2–3 reps or skip

- **Friday — Aerobic Development**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 45 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 30 min light movement or mobility

---

### **Phase 2: Accumulation (4–6 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Increase anaerobic capacity, gradually build lactic tolerance, maintain aerobic base.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Alactic Power + Aerobic**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 10 x 10-sec sprints, 60–90 sec rest + 30 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 20–30 min Zone 2 only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Anaerobic Lactic)**  
  - Normal HRV: Train as usual
  - Low HRV: Flow roll + 10 min light cardio

- **Wednesday — BJJ + Aerobic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 20–30 min Zone 2 post-training
  - Low HRV: Light movement or skip

- **Thursday — BJJ + Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 6 x 10-sec sprints, 60–90 sec rest
  - Low HRV: Reduce to 3 reps or skip

- **Friday — Lactic Threshold Intervals**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 5 x 20-sec all-out efforts (2 min rest), 20 min Zone 2 flush
  - Low HRV: Replace intervals with light aerobic work

---

### **Phase 3: Intensification (3–4 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Peak anaerobic systems, maximize lactic power, sharpen competition-specific conditioning.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Alactic Power + Aerobic Flush**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 6–8 x 10-sec sprints, 60-sec rest + 20 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 20 min light movement only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Anaerobic Lactic)**  
  - Normal HRV: Hard rolling sessions
  - Low HRV: Short rounds or flow rolling

- **Wednesday — Aerobic Recovery**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 30 min light Zone 2
  - Low HRV: Active recovery or rest

- **Thursday — BJJ + Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 4 x 10-sec sprints, full rest
  - Low HRV: Drop sprints entirely

- **Friday — Lactic Power Intervals**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 6 x 30-sec max effort (3 min rest), 15 min light cardio
  - Low HRV: 20 min light aerobic work instead

---

### **Phase 4: Deload & Peaking (1–2 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Recover, supercompensate, and peak for performance.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Aerobic Flush + Light Alactic**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 3–4 x 10-sec sprints, 20 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 20 min light movement only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Light Rolling)**  
  - Normal HRV: Short rounds or flow rolling
  - Low HRV: Minimal drilling or rest

- **Wednesday — Recovery**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 20 min light cardio or mobility
  - Low HRV: Complete rest

- **Thursday — Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 2–3 short sprints
  - Low HRV: Skip

- **Friday — Final Aerobic Flush**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 20 min light Zone 2
  - Low HRV: Walk or rest

## **Repeatable Macrocycle (16 Weeks)**

This cycle is designed for ongoing development. Athletes can repeat it indefinitely, progressing sprint volume, lactic interval density, or aerobic volume over time.

**Phase structure is the same:**
1. **Aerobic & Alactic Foundation (4 weeks)**
2. **Lactic Capacity Development (4 weeks)**
3. **Anaerobic Power & Intensity (4 weeks)**
4. **Deload & Recalibration (4 weeks)**

By cycling through these phases, athletes continually build and maintain well-rounded conditioning, while HRV tracking ensures they avoid burnout.
