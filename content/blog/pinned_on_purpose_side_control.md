# Pinned on Purpose: Side Control

## TLDR; Side Control Sucks.

## How Regressive Games Turn Getting Smashed into a Superpower

Side control sucks. You know it, I know it, and your training partners definitely know it, which is why they keep putting you there.

But what if being pinned wasn’t a problem to avoid, but a space to explore?

This post is all about creating intentional, structured training environments that teach athletes how to escape side control not with desperation, but with clarity, confidence, and real skill. We’ll walk through a regressive game series, inspired by the excellent work of coach Kabir Bath, that helps athletes thrive under pressure by spending more time in the positions they usually try to avoid.

Let’s talk about getting pinned on purpose.

## Why We Avoid Side Control (and Why We Shouldn’t)

Most grapplers spend more time dreading side control than learning from it. That makes sense. It’s uncomfortable, restrictive, and often humiliating. But when we avoid these positions, we rob ourselves of crucial learning opportunities.

Side control is a problem-rich learning environment, especially when:

- You're flattened  
- Your options feel narrow and unfamiliar  
- Your escapes happen, but in a panicked blur

## The Power of Regressive Game Design

Regressive games start at the end of a sequence and work backward. Instead of learning the entire escape chain from standing or guard, we zoom in on the hardest, most critical piece — the part where you're flat on your back, already pinned — and start there.

This approach:

- Extends exposure to high-value moments  
- Highlights key constraints and concepts  
- Builds confidence through small, progressive wins  
- Promotes nonlinear learning and adaptability  

Kabir Bath breaks down these principles beautifully in his coaching content. If you haven't already, check him out:

## The Side Control Escape Series: Pinned On Purpose

These games are structured around live resistance, win conditions, and clear roles for both players. Inspired by Kabir Bath’s four-game framework, the goal is to build adaptable escape skills for the bottom player while giving the top player meaningful offensive objectives beyond just "hold the pin."

### Game 1: Chest-to-Chest Pin Control

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Chest-to-chest side control, one arm under the head, one under the far-side armpit, hands connected.  
- **Objective**: Prevent rotation and framing while isolating one arm.  
- **Constraints**: Must maintain chest-to-chest contact; no submissions allowed.  
- **Win Condition**: Isolate and control one arm using a bent arm control (Kimura or Americana), with wrist control, bent elbow, and figure-four reinforcement.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Flat on back, fully pinned.  
- **Objective**: Create space and escape.  
- **Constraints**: Must begin flat and controlled.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, seated guard, or full guard.

### Game 2: Double Arm Isolation

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Same as Game 1.  
- **Objective**: Pin and isolate both arms.  
- **Constraints**: No submissions allowed; must maintain pin.  
- **Win Condition**: Achieve bent arm control on both arms with wrist control, bent elbow, and figure-four reinforcement.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Same as Game 1.  
- **Objective**: Defend isolation and escape.  
- **Constraints**: Must begin grounded; no stand-ups.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, seated guard, or full guard.

---

### Game 3: Open Side Control Scramble

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Side control with chest pressure but no underhooks or head control.  
- **Objective**: Isolate one arm or transition to dominant position.  
- **Constraints**: No submissions; can move to mount.  
- **Win Condition**: Establish bent arm control on one arm or regain dominant pin.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Bottom side control with partial frames allowed.  
- **Objective**: Escape and regain structure.  
- **Constraints**: Must remain in-contact; realistic pressure.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, seated guard, or full guard.

---

### Game 4: Fully Live Side Control

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Any live side control variation.  
- **Objective**: Attack, submit, or progress positionally.  
- **Constraints**: None.  
- **Win Condition**: Submission, mount, or sustained control.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Any bottom side control variation.  
- **Objective**: Defend and escape or reverse.  
- **Constraints**: None.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, seated guard, full guard, or reversal.

## Why This Works

These games create purposeful struggle with enough structure to support growth. They're not about reps in isolation. They're about reps in context. By starting in the deepest part of the problem and layering complexity back in, you:

- Normalize discomfort  
- Learn to regulate and respond instead of panic  
- Discover personal solutions, not just techniques  
- Build real-world competence in one of grappling’s most oppressive positions  

And you do it all without needing an encyclopedic escape system, just intelligent, targeted exposure.

## Final Thoughts: Make Side Control Your Laboratory

There’s nothing noble about avoiding your weak spots. But there’s something powerful about choosing to stay in them, intentionally, repeatedly, and curiously.

Side control isn’t the place where development stops. It’s where it starts. Especially if you’re willing to get pinned on purpose and use that time to learn.

So next time you find yourself under a pressure monster with your soul slowly leaving your body, smile a little.

You asked for this.

And you’re getting better because of it.
