## How Regressive Games Turn Getting Smashed into a Superpower

Side control sucks. You know it, I know it, and your training partners definitely know it, which is why they keep putting you there.

But what if being pinned wasn’t a problem to avoid, but a space to explore?

This post is all about creating scenarios that teach athletes how to deal with side control. We’ll walk through a regressive game series, inspired by the work of coach Kabir Bath, that helps athletes thrive under pressure by spending more time in the positions they usually try to avoid.

Let’s talk about getting pinned on purpose.

## Why We Avoid Side Control (and Why We Shouldn’t)

Most grapplers spend more time dreading side control than learning from it. That makes sense. It’s uncomfortable, restrictive, and often humiliating. But when we avoid these positions, we rob ourselves of crucial learning opportunities.

Side control is a problem-rich learning environment, especially when:

- You're flattened  
- Your options feel narrow and unfamiliar  
- Your escapes happen, but in a panicked blur

## The Power of Regressive Game Design

Regressive games start at the end of a sequence and work backward. Instead of learning the entire escape chain from standing or guard, we zoom in on the hardest, most critical piece — the part where you're flat on your back, already pinned — and start there.

This approach:

- Extends exposure to high-value moments  
- Highlights key constraints and concepts  
- Builds confidence through small, progressive wins 

Kabir Bath breaks down these principles beautifully in his coaching content. If you haven't already, check him out:

## The Side Control Escape Series: Pinned On Purpose

These games are structured around live resistance, win conditions, and clear roles for both players. Inspired by Kabir Bath’s four-game framework, the goal is to build adaptable escape skills for the bottom player while giving the top player meaningful offensive objectives.

### Game 1: Chest-to-Chest Side Control

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Chest-to-chest side control, one arm under the head, one under the far-side armpit, hands connected.  
- **Objective**: Prevent rotation and framing while isolating one arm.  
- **Constraints**: Must maintain chest-to-chest contact; no submissions allowed.  
- **Win Condition**: Isolate and control one arm using a figure four grip.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Flat on back, fully pinned.  
- **Objective**: Create space and escape.  
- **Constraints**: Must begin flat and controlled.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, bring your legs between yourself and your partner, or reverse the position to become top player.

### Game 2: Rotation and Arm Isolation

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Chest-to-chest side control, one arm under the head, one under the far-side armpit, hands connected.
- **Objective**: Maintain pressure through your transition and isolate an arm. 
- **Constraints**: No submissions allowed; must maintain pin.  
- **Win Condition**: Keep your partner flattened to the mat, transition to side control on the oppsite side of your partner's torso, and achieve a figure 4 grip on the far side arm.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Flat on back, fully pinned.  
- **Objective**: Defend isolation and escape.  
- **Constraints**: None.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, bring your legs between yourself and your partner, or reverse the position to become top player.

### Game 3: Open Side Control Scramble

**Top Player**:
- **Position**: Side control with chest pressure but no underhooks or head control.  
- **Objective**: Isolate one arm or transition to another dominant position.  
- **Constraints**: No submissions.  
- **Win Condition**: Establish figure four control on one arm or transition to mount.

**Bottom Player**:
- **Position**: Bottom side control with partial frames allowed.  
- **Objective**: Escape and regain structure.  
- **Constraints**: None.  
- **Win Condition**: Escape to turtle, bring your legs between yourself and your partner, or reverse the position to become top player.

## Why This Works

These games create purposeful struggle with enough structure to support growth. They're not about reps in isolation. They're about reps in context. By starting in the deepest part of the problem and layering complexity back in, you:

- Normalize discomfort  
- Learn to regulate and respond instead of panic  
- Discover personal solutions, not just techniques  
- Build real-world competence in one of grappling’s most oppressive positions  

And you do it all without needing an encyclopedic escape system, just intelligent, targeted exposure.

## Final Thoughts: Make Side Control Your Laboratory

There’s nothing noble about avoiding your weak spots. But there’s something powerful about choosing to stay in them, intentionally, repeatedly, and curiously.

Discomfort isn’t the place where development stops. It’s where it starts. Especially if you’re willing to get pinned on purpose and use that time to learn.

So next time you find yourself suffering under a pin, smile a little.

You asked for this.

And you’re getting better because of it.
