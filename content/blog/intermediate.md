I've been thinking about what major checkpoints myself and others in the club would need to reach in order to be considered an "intermediate" grappler. 

This is actually an easier question to answer for those who compete. When you are nearing the next stage in your grappling journey you'll start seeing more and more success amongst your peers in competition. When that happens, the time to progress is close! That said, **everyone** loves having the ability to track their progress in things. 

Ultimately the question is this: how can someone who does not plan to compete track their own progress in a meaningful way that enables them to improve intentionally?

My answer is below, and it is **heavily** inspired by coach Rob Biernacki's criteria for belt promotions. You can find his blue belt criteria at [Grapple Arts](https://www.grapplearts.com/blue-belt-techniques/), and if you enjoy that I would seriously encourage you to sign up for his online content at [BJJ Concepts](https://bjjconcepts.net/). If you're interested in coaching the instructor tier is definitely worth it.

I've chosen to stick with beginner and intermediate categories for now instead of leaning into a belt structure. Primarily because our club is exclusively no gi, and secondarily because the goal is for folks to track their own progress.

Where you see "A/B" this implies that athletes should have two viable options that are connected in a way that forms a dilemma for your opponent. 


### Intermediate Grappler Criteria

##### Initiate:
* A/B Attacks from standing (no more than one guard pull)
* Gain & maintain connected guards
* Defend against 2 chained standing attacks

##### Progress:
* A/B Passing movements
* A/B Escapes from each of side, top, & back mounts
Transition between dominant positions (side control, knee on belly, top & back mounts)

##### Attack:
* A/B sweep attacks
* A/B upper body submissions
* A/B lower body submissions

A/B implies a chain of movements where if A fails B is an actionable second movement. 


Attack:
Sweep completion
Upper body submissions
Lower body submissions
