This plan includes an **onboarding macrocycle** to build foundational conditioning, followed by a **repeatable macrocycle** to sustain and progressively enhance fitness over time. Both cycles balance aerobic, alactic, and lactic systems, with HRV guiding daily intensity adjustments.

## **Types of Energy System Conditioning**

### **Aerobic System Training**

#### Cardiac Output Method
The cardiac output method involves training at a constant heartrate of 120-150 BPM. The younger the participant the higher in the HR range they should work. This should be done 1-3 times each week for 45-90 minutes.

This can be done using one single exercise or a series of exercises targeting the cardiac output HR Range. Any low intensity low pressure exercise will work.

If your resting heart rate is 60-79 you should regularly prioritize aerobic training.

This increases eccentric cardiac hypertrophy by stretching cardiac fibers which leads to an increase in left ventricular cavity volume.

#### Cardiac Power Intervals
Perform maximum intensity intervals of 60-120 seconds with 2-5 minutes of rest or a heart rate recovery of 120-130. The goal is to keep your heart rate as elevated as possible during each interval.

Any high intensity exercise that maximizes working heart rate such as sprinting or other high intensity circuits.

Each session should contain 4-12 reps and there should be 1-2 sessions per week.

#### Tempo Method

## **Onboarding Macrocycle (16 Weeks)**

### **Phase 1: Base Building (4–6 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Build aerobic capacity, develop alactic power, and gradually introduce lactic work.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Aerobic + Alactic Power**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 8 x 10-sec sprints, 90-sec rest + 40 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 30–40 min Zone 2 only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Anaerobic Lactic)**  
  - Normal HRV: Train as usual
  - Low HRV: Flow roll + 15 min recovery cardio

- **Wednesday — BJJ + Aerobic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 30 min Zone 2 post-training
  - Low HRV: 15 min light walking or skip

- **Thursday — BJJ + Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 5 x 10-sec sprints, 90-sec rest
  - Low HRV: Reduce to 2–3 reps or skip

- **Friday — Aerobic Development**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 45 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 30 min light movement or mobility

---

### **Phase 2: Accumulation (4–6 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Increase anaerobic capacity, gradually build lactic tolerance, maintain aerobic base.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Alactic Power + Aerobic**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 10 x 10-sec sprints, 60–90 sec rest + 30 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 20–30 min Zone 2 only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Anaerobic Lactic)**  
  - Normal HRV: Train as usual
  - Low HRV: Flow roll + 10 min light cardio

- **Wednesday — BJJ + Aerobic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 20–30 min Zone 2 post-training
  - Low HRV: Light movement or skip

- **Thursday — BJJ + Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 6 x 10-sec sprints, 60–90 sec rest
  - Low HRV: Reduce to 3 reps or skip

- **Friday — Lactic Threshold Intervals**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 5 x 20-sec all-out efforts (2 min rest), 20 min Zone 2 flush
  - Low HRV: Replace intervals with light aerobic work

---

### **Phase 3: Intensification (3–4 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Peak anaerobic systems, maximize lactic power, sharpen competition-specific conditioning.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Alactic Power + Aerobic Flush**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 6–8 x 10-sec sprints, 60-sec rest + 20 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 20 min light movement only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Anaerobic Lactic)**  
  - Normal HRV: Hard rolling sessions
  - Low HRV: Short rounds or flow rolling

- **Wednesday — Aerobic Recovery**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 30 min light Zone 2
  - Low HRV: Active recovery or rest

- **Thursday — BJJ + Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 4 x 10-sec sprints, full rest
  - Low HRV: Drop sprints entirely

- **Friday — Lactic Power Intervals**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 6 x 30-sec max effort (3 min rest), 15 min light cardio
  - Low HRV: 20 min light aerobic work instead

---

### **Phase 4: Deload & Peaking (1–2 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Recover, supercompensate, and peak for performance.

**Weekly Schedule:**
- **Monday — Aerobic Flush + Light Alactic**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 3–4 x 10-sec sprints, 20 min Zone 2
  - Low HRV: 20 min light movement only

- **Tuesday — BJJ (Light Rolling)**  
  - Normal HRV: Short rounds or flow rolling
  - Low HRV: Minimal drilling or rest

- **Wednesday — Recovery**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 20 min light cardio or mobility
  - Low HRV: Complete rest

- **Thursday — Alactic Maintenance**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 2–3 short sprints
  - Low HRV: Skip

- **Friday — Final Aerobic Flush**  
  - Normal/High HRV: 20 min light Zone 2
  - Low HRV: Walk or rest

## **Repeatable Macrocycle (16 Weeks)**

This cycle is designed for ongoing development. Athletes can repeat it indefinitely, progressing sprint volume, lactic interval density, or aerobic volume over time.

**Phase structure is the same:**
1. **Aerobic & Alactic Foundation (4 weeks)**
2. **Lactic Capacity Development (4 weeks)**
3. **Anaerobic Power & Intensity (4 weeks)**
4. **Deload & Recalibration (4 weeks)**

By cycling through these phases, athletes continually build and maintain well-rounded conditioning, while HRV tracking ensures they avoid burnout.

Would you like me to refine work-to-rest ratios, add more peaking strategies, or adjust aerobic volume? Let me know!
