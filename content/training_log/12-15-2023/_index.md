## Open Guard Retention/Passing

**Game #1**: [Create and Break Connections]( /games/guard_games/open_guard/create_and_break_connections/ )

**Game #2**: [Open Guard Sweeping](/games/guard_games/open_guard/open_guard_sweeping/)

**Game #3**:

Top player attempts to open their partner's guard and immobilize one of their partner's legs for 3 seconds. Bottom player attempts to sweep and maintain guard.

This session focused heavily on opening the closed guard. Some IP lessons were mixed in to test retention: hip switch opening, wet dog, and the rolling back take.
