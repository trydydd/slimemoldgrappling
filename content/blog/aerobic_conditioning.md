Aerobic conditioning improves conditioning through two main pathways: increasing the efficiency of the heart or increasing the efficiency of muscle tissue. 


#### Cardiac Output Method

The cardiac output method involves training at a constant heartrate of 120-150 BPM. The younger the participant the higher in the HR range they should work. This should be done 1-3 times each week for 45-90 minutes.

This can be done using one single exercise or a series of exercises targeting the cardiac output HR Range. Any low intensity low pressure exercise will work.

If your resting heart rate is 60-79 you should regularly prioritize aerobic training.

This increases eccentric cardiac hypertrophy by stretching cardiac fibers which leads to an increase in left ventricular cavity volume.

#### Cardiac Power Intervals
Perform maximum intensity intervals of 60-120 seconds with 2-5 minutes of rest or a heart rate recovery of 120-130. The goal is to keep your heart rate as elevated as possible during each interval.

Any high intensity exercise that maximizes working heart rate such as sprinting or other high intensity circuits.

Each session should contain 4-12 reps and there should be 1-2 sessions per week.

This increases the contractile strength of the heart which increases how much blood the heart can pump.

#### Tempo Method
Perform any major compound multi-joint lift (squat, bench, deadlift, pull-ups, etc).

Each session should contain 3-5 exercises, 3-5 sets of 8-10 reps per exercise, 6-8 minutes active rest between sets, and two seconds of concentric/eccentric movement per rep with no paueses at the top or bottom.

This causes hypertrophy in the slow twitch fibers which aids in preventing over fatigue from anaerobic exercise. Slow twitch fibers are where the a large amount of lactate is oxidized.

#### High Intensity Continous Training
Use a spin bike, versaclimber, rower, etc.

Each session should contain 1-2 sets of 10-20 minutes with maximum resistance and low speed (20-30 rpm on a bike) and 5-10 minutes active rest between sets. Perform 1-2x per week.

This will increase the efficiency of oxygen utilization of fast twitch muscle fibers, and offers a high level of stimulus due to both high volume and high intensity.

#### Threshold Training
The point at which your body shifts the majority of ATP generation from aerobic to anaerobic is called the anaerobic threshold. In order to utilize threshold training you must determine your anaerobic threshold. You can do this at a lab using a gas exchange test or use Joel Jamieson's method for roughly estimating it:

Work 3x5 minute sparring rounds with 60 seconds rest between each round while wearing a heart rate monitor. Find your average heart rate across all three rounds, excluding rest time, this is the heartrate that you use for the threshold training method. 

Perform 2-5 reps of any cardio exercise, 3-10 minutes per rep, keep your working hr withing 5 bpm of your anaerobic threshold, and perform 1-2x per week.

This will improve the aerobic capabilities of fast twitch fibers allowing for a longer power generation timeline.

#### Aerobic Plyometrics
Perform double leg bounds, explosive push-ups, or medicine ball rebounds. 

Perform 1-3 sets of 5-10 minutes per session. Keep you heartrate below your anaerobic threshold and rest 10-30 seconds between sets.

This will improve the aerobic capabilities of fast twitch fibers allowing for a longer power generation timeline.

#### Explosive Repeats
This method involves explosive exercises such as squat jumps and explosive pushups.

Perform 1-2 series of 6-10 sets per exercise using 1-3 exercises per workout with 8-10 minutes of active rest between series and exercises.

3 week example:
* **Week One**: 8-10s work 60s rest
* **Week Two**: 10-12s work 40s rest
* **Week Three**: 12-14s work 30s rest

This reduces the time needed for your fast twitch fibers to recover between explosive bursts.
