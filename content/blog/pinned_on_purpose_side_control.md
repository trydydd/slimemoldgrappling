# Pinned on Purpose: Side Control

## TLDR; Side Control Sucks.
[Games Series](##The Side Control Escape Series: Pinned On Purpose)

## How Regressive Games Turn Getting Smashed into a Superpower

Side control sucks. You know it, I know it, and your training partners definitely know it, which is why they keep putting you there.

But what if being pinned wasn’t a problem to avoid, but a space to explore?

This post is all about creating intentional, structured training environments that teach athletes how to escape side control not with desperation, but with clarity, confidence, and real skill. We’ll walk through a regressive game series, inspired by the excellent work of coach Kabir Bath, that helps athletes thrive under pressure by spending more time in the positions they usually try to avoid.

Let’s talk about getting pinned on purpose.

## Why We Avoid Side Control (and Why We Shouldn’t)

Most grapplers spend more time dreading side control than learning from it. That makes sense. It’s uncomfortable, restrictive, and often humiliating. But when we avoid these positions, we rob ourselves of crucial learning opportunities.

Side control is a problem-rich learning environment, especially when:

- You're flattened
- Your options feel narrow and unfamiliar  
- Your escapes happen, but in a panicked blur

## The Power of Regressive Game Design

Regressive games start at the end of a sequence and work backward. Instead of learning the entire escape chain from standing or guard, we zoom in on the hardest, most critical piece — the part where you're flat on your back, already pinned — and start there.

This approach:

- Extends exposure to high-value moments  
- Highlights key constraints and concepts  
- Builds confidence through small, progressive wins  
- Promotes nonlinear learning and adaptability  

Kabir Bath breaks down these principles beautifully in his coaching content. If you haven't already, check him out:

## The Side Control Escape Series: Pinned On Purpose

Here’s a simple four-game progression that builds side control escape skill from the worst-case scenario upward.

---

### Game 1: Crossface Survival

**Start:** Flat on your back in tight side control, crossface and underhook fully established  
**Top Player:** Maintain the pin only, no transitions or submissions  
**Bottom Player:** Relieve pressure, recover inside space, or establish a working frame  

*Learning Objective:* Sensitize to the smallest openings for escape. Learn to move even when pinned.

---

### Game 2: Connection Shift

**Start:** Side control with no underhook, only crossface  
**Top Player:** Try to reestablish underhook or improve position  
**Bottom Player:** Frame, move, and transition to knee shield, turtle, or any meaningful guard  

*Learning Objective:* Feel how frames and underhooks change your options. Explore timing windows.

---

### Game 3: Limited Pressure Live

**Start:** Side control with no grips or specific constraints  
**Top Player:** Can apply chest-to-chest pressure and move positionally, but no submissions  
**Bottom Player:** Escape fully or create meaningful connection  

*Learning Objective:* Work in live but simplified environments. Escape under transitional pressure.

---

### Game 4: Fully Live Side Control

**Start:** Standard side control  
**Top Player:** No constraints. Submissions, transitions, and pressure are all allowed  
**Bottom Player:** Survive, escape, and use everything you've learned to regain agency  

*Learning Objective:* Apply pressure-tested skills in a fully chaotic, high-information state.

## Why This Works

These games create purposeful struggle with enough structure to support growth. They're not about reps in isolation. They're about reps in context. By starting in the deepest part of the problem and layering complexity back in, you:

- Normalize discomfort  
- Learn to regulate and respond instead of panic  
- Discover personal solutions, not just techniques  
- Build real-world competence in one of grappling’s most oppressive positions  

And you do it all without needing an encyclopedic escape system, just intelligent, targeted exposure.

## Final Thoughts: Make Side Control Your Laboratory

There’s nothing noble about avoiding your weak spots. But there’s something powerful about choosing to stay in them, intentionally, repeatedly, and curiously.

Side control isn’t the place where development stops. It’s where it starts. Especially if you’re willing to get pinned on purpose and use that time to learn.

So next time you find yourself under a pressure monster with your soul slowly leaving your body, smile a little.

You asked for this.

And you’re getting better because of it.
