  * **Position**: Seated with your partner in ashi garami with an overhook/wrap on your opponent's captured leg.
  * **Objective**: Slowly apply the finishing mechanics of the straight ankle lock.
  * **Constraints**: Move as slowly as possible while applying pressure to the ankle.
  * **Win Condition**: Your partner taps.

**Defending Player**:
  * **Position**: Inside your partner's ashi garami with an overhook/wrap on your captured leg.
  * **Objective**: Tap early as your partner slowly applies finishing mechanics for the straight ankle lock.
  * **Constraints**: None
  * **Win Condition**: None

  Reset when attacking player wins.
