**Attribution**: This lesson plan is based on a [BJJ Globetrotters Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsaDeiRO7s8) with coach Rob Cole.

**Top Player**:
  * **Position**: Any creative start (e.g., belly down, inverted, seated, ankle lock-style)
  * **Objective**: Control opponent’s knee/ankle and come up to top
  * **Constraints**: No submissions, no disengaging, must maintain contact
  * **Win Condition**: Come up with opponent’s ankle/knee off mat and maintain control for 2 seconds

**Bottom Player**:
  * **Position**: Same—any orientation, but physically connected
  * **Objective**: Win scramble by coming to top with ankle/knee control
  * **Constraints**: Must start connected and remain so until the scramble resolves
  * **Win Condition**: Come up into top with control for 2 seconds
